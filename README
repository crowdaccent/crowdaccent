This describes the crowdaccent project structure.

Directory structure
===================

Here is the proposed directory structure: 
  
   |-code
   |---build
   |---deploy
   |---scripts
   |---src
   |-docs
   |---coding_guidelines
   |---functional_specs
   |---qa_test_plans
   |---release_notes
   |---technical_docs


The top level directories will be created as project submodules.
